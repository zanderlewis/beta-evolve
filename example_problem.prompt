Implement a NASA-grade binary search algorithm in C.

The algorithm should:
1. Take a sorted array and a target value as input
2. Return the index of the target value if found, or -1 if not found
3. Use the divide and conquer approach
4. Include proper error handling for edge cases
5. Include a main function with test cases

Requirements:
- The function should be named `binary_search`
- Handle empty arrays gracefully
- Include comprehensive test cases that verify correctness
- Use efficient integer arithmetic to avoid overflow
- Add comments explaining the algorithm logic
